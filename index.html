            <p>
                Hello! This page explains the privacy policy for the <strong>GitTrack</strong> Chrome Extension.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe in privacy and transparency. Our goal is to create a useful tool while respecting your data. The extension is designed to work entirely on your computer.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Permissions and Data Usage</h2>
        <p>The extension requests the following permissions:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong><code>storage</code></strong>: This is the most important permission we use.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Why we need it:</strong> To save the status of job applications you track (e.g., "Applied," "Interested").
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How it's used:</strong> When you mark a job on a GitHub page, that status is saved using Chrome's built-in storage API. This allows the extension to remember your choices when you revisit the page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>What we DON'T do:</strong> This data is stored <strong>locally on your computer only</strong>. It is never sent to any external server, and we (the developers) have absolutely no access to it. We do not collect, store, or sell any of your personal data.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><code>tabs</code></strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Why we need it:</strong> This permission helps the extension know when you are on a compatible GitHub jobs page, so it can activate its features at the right time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Since all your tracking data is stored locally on your device, it is as secure as your own computer. We do not have access to it, and it never leaves your machine through our extension.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this privacy policy in the future. Any changes will be reflected on this page.
        </p>
